    <h2>Nicole's Best Spinach Artichoke Dip Tips</h2>
    <p>All the best dips start with cream cheese, according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/author/nicole-mclaughlin/">NicoleMcMom</a>). This spinach artichoke dip is proof! Here are a few of Nicole's tips and tricks for making the best spinach artichoke dip of your life:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's important that your cream cheese is softened before you start mixing the ingredients. Otherwise, it won't incorporate well.</li>
        <li>Mix everything together before you add the spinach and artichokes. You'll want to get the cream cheese mixture well-blended first so the veggies stay intact.</li>
        <li>Squeeze out as much moisture as you can before you add the spinach so the dip doesn't get runny.</li>
        <li>If you want to make spinach artichoke dip in advance, mix all the ingredients together — but don't bake it. Store it in the fridge for a day or two, then bake it right before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Can You Freeze Spinach Artichoke Dip?</h2>
    <p>You can freeze spinach artichoke dip for up to three months. However, we don't recommend it — the creamy ingredients will separate and become watery during the freezing and thawing process.</p>

        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>

        <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a small baking dish.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, garlic, basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Gently stir in artichoke hearts and spinach.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish; top with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.</p>
