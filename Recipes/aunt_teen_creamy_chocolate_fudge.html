    <p>Store the fudge in an airtight container (with wax paper between layers) at room temperature for one to two weeks. There's no need to refrigerate fudge.</p>
    <p>To freeze fudge, wrap it tightly in wax paper, then wrap it again in aluminum foil. Place the foil-wrapped fudge in a freezer-safe container or wrap it in another layer of foil. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.</p>

    <h1>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h1>
    <p>"I have made this fudge several times over the years and have followed the recipe to a tee every time and have gotten perfect results," raves <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/14566277">jtrzcinski</a>. "This fudge is so creamy and delicious, it is requested by family and friends every year."</p>
    <p>"I stuck to the recipe and it was wonderful," says <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/4449372">Chris Simmons</a>. "My only suggestion: ALWAYS put nuts in the oven for a quick roast/toast before putting them in sweets. Toasting the walnuts before putting them in the fudge released a warmer nutty flavor and crisped the walnuts so that it made the fudge even more amazing, and offset some of the sweetness."</p>
    <p>"This is super easy, but you have to watch it and stir constantly," according to <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/4545125"> marybeth bellardini</a>. "I didn't make a single change and it comes out perfectly every single time. Definitely a keeper."</p>
